          GTRC is a community space for everyone.

Personally we know how daunting it can be to show up and run with a group of people who already know each other. Thatâ€™s partly why we started this thing because we were too anxious to join someone elseâ€™s club.

But everyone who comes along was a stranger to the club at some point, we will always come over and have a chat with new runners. Come say hi, even once and youâ€™ll be made to feel like part of the team.

You donâ€™t even have to run. Just turn up for a chat if you want a bit of company!

We donâ€™t run at any set pace, if you need to slow down, someone will slow down with you. If you need to stop during a run, thatâ€™s fine, someone will stop and walk with you ðŸ’™
