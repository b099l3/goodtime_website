Come and join us for yoga... with a running twist!  

We'll be hosted by our friends at Up & Running Edinburgh to continue our theme of creating strong foundations – from our feet. 

What can you expect?

Firstly, a very warm welcome 😊
Gentle, yet fun and energising movement designed specifically for those of who like to run, jog or shuffle
A workshop of four parts:
Breathwork, grounding and mobilising yoga to get us warmed up for...
A short test run/jog/shuffle round the West End
Post-run stretching and relaxation
⁠Restoration and replenishment (i.e. great coffee and treats)
Great tunes (never any ‘yoga music!)
Absolute beginners absolutely welcome... if I had £1 for every time I heard the words 'I'm not flexible enough for yoga' from runners then I'd be doing pretty well 😊
15% discount on all items in Up & Running after the session
What will be provided?

Yoga mats, though please feel free to bring your own if you prefer
A post-session coffee or tea of your choice - please state what drink you'd like when confirming your spot 
Vegan treats
A few requirements before the session...

Please let me know if you have any significant injuries
Dress comfortably – something you can move comfortably in, with suitable outdoor layers for the run
Remember to bring your running shoes – the run will be short, and whilst the yoga is barefooted I don’t recommend that for running round the West End 😉
We're really looking forward to welcoming you all – it’s going to be a great morning. Please give us a shout if you need anything in the meantime.
