Sundays - On Sunday mornings we meet on the Portobello prom before head out for a longer run. Afterwards weâ€™ll hang out and grab something to eat/drink from @crumbs_of_portobello afterwards. There are options for 5km at 11am, 10km at 10:30am, and 15km at 10am. All of which start and end at Crumbs.
